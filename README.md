# SignUpForm
Displays a sign up form with fields for name, email, password, and password confirmation. Also has an "enter" button on the screen that,
when pressed, first checks if the fields are all filled. If any are empty, it will ask the user to fill the fields and mark the empty
fields with a red background. If all the fields are filled, then the onClickListener will check if the password and password confirmation
are the same. If they are not, it will ask the user to make them the same. If all fields are filled and the passwords are equal, then the
app will greet the user using the name provided.
